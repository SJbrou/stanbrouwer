I've always thinkered around with tech and built dozens of little site projects. Now I finally made the step and bought a domain. This site currently is a Jekyll project with a lot of bootstrap5 hosted on GitHub pages. There are some projects that requre more backend so a migration to AWS EC2 is planned.
