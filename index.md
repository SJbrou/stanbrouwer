I've always thinkered around with tech and built dozens of little site projects. Now I finally made the step and bought a domain. This site currently is a Jekyll project with a lot of bootstrap5 hosted on GitHub pages. There are some projects that requre more backend so a migration to AWS EC2 is planned.

    /* ensure image is not to dark on main page */
header.masthead .overlay {
            position: absolute;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            height: 100%;
            width: 100%;
            background-color: $gray-900;
            opacity: 0.3 !important;
}
