Welcome to my corner of the internet. 
<br>

I've always wanted my own place where I could
<!--
[publish my thoughts](/activity.html)
[share my university projects](/activity.html)
[introduce myself](/me.html)
-->
- Publish my thoughts
- Share my university projects
- Introuce myself
<br>

Finally I made the step and bought the domain. This site currently is a Jekyll project with hosted on GitHub pages. I couldn't live with the template I started with, so decided to rebuild the whole site by myself. 


<style>
    /* ensure image is not to dark on main page */
header.masthead .overlay {
            position: absolute;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            height: 100%;
            width: 100%;
            background-color: $gray-900;
            opacity: 0.3 !important;
}
</style>

<script>
    window.location.href = "/me.html";
</script>
