After having participated in the European Youth Parliament nationally and represented the netherlands internationally, my best friend and I organized the regional selection conference of the EYP in Hoorn. It was a 5-day event with 150 participants from all over Europe. I oversaw the organization of the event, including the hosting, fundraising, logistics and programme.
