After having participated in the European Youth Parliament nationally and represented the Netherlands internationally, my best friend and I organised the regional selection conference of the EYP in Hoorn. We oversaw the organisation of the event, including the hosting, catering, fundraising, logistics and programme for more than 130 participants from all over Europe for 5 days.
