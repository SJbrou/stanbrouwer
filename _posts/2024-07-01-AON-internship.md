In the transition form my bachelor to my master's I took a summer internship as data scientist at AON, where I applied machine learning to determine the optimal consumer segments for new insurance products. My role was to analyze much of the CBS open source data, combine it with internal data and apply clustering algorithms to determine the optimal segments. I developed a dashboard to visualize the results and communicated all findings to the team.
