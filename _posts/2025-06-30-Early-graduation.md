Expected early graduation date from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam with a Master of Science in Information Sciences. <br><br>

The information sciences master programme focuses on the scientific study of information, including data science, computer science, and information systems with a strong focus on digitalisation in business and sustainability. I was particularly intrested in the application of statistical methods to predict greenhouse gas emissions, with a thesis on the application of IoT data and machine learning to model the emissions of corporate real estate for Capgemini. <br><br>

Next to the programme I completed 40 ECTS of additional courses in computer science, data science and economics. I served as a chair of the programme committee for Information Sciences, helped organising taster days and other events, and was actively involved in teaching and developing edicuation at an other faculty: the School of Business and Economics.
