While teaching sports lessons I often wanted to make courses more interactive, for instance when we discussed threshold training, I wanted to show the relationship between power output, heart rate, duration and lactate. Adittionally, I wanted students to be able to calculate their own thresholds and determine their own power-endurance curves. 
<br><br>

Adittionally, the lessons were too short to dive deeper into the details of human physiology. I wanted to create a resource that students could use to learn more about the subject in their own time, if they found the topic intresting. 
<br><br>

Thus, I summarized my human movement science knowledge on physiology in three lessons on endurance training, and my experience in power sports in three lessons on strenght. Adittionally, I build a node.JS backend with SQLite database to store the data of the students. The website was hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and the frontend had two different versions: a student version where they could quickly post results to the server and see their own results, and a teacher version where that could be used to visualise the results of the entire class on a separate TV. 
<br><br>

As I'm no longer teaching the course I have disabled my AWS instances, but a archive of the course page in static quatro format can be found here: <br><br> [https://sjbrou.github.io/Metenisweten/](https://sjbrou.github.io/Metenisweten/Row.html)
