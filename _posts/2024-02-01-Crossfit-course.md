While teaching sports lessons, I often felt the need to make the courses more interactive. For example, when discussing threshold training, I wanted to demonstrate the relationship between power output, heart rate, duration, and lactate. Additionally, I wanted students to be able to calculate their own thresholds and create their personalized power-endurance curves.
<br><br>

However, the lessons were often too short to dive deeply into the details of human physiology. I realized I needed to create a resource that students could explore on their own time, especially if they found the topic intriguing.
<br><br>

So, I summarized my human movement science knowledge on physiology in three lessons on endurance training, and my experience in power sports in three lessons on strenght. additionaly, I built a Node.js backend with an SQLite database to store students' data. The site was hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I developed two versions of the frontend: one for students to easily submit their results and track their progress, and one for teachers to visualize the entire class's results on a separate screen.
<br><br>

Since I'm no longer teaching the course, I have disabled the AWS instances. However, you can still access an archive of the course page in static Quatro format: <br><br> [https://sjbrou.github.io/Metenisweten/](https://sjbrou.github.io/Metenisweten/Row.html)
