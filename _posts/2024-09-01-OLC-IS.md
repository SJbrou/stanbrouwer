Served as the student chair on the programme committee for Information Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The programme committee is responsible for advising the faculty on matters related to the curriculum, teaching quality, and student welfare. As chair, I facilitated discussions between students and faculty, on topics such as the use of generative AI in education.
