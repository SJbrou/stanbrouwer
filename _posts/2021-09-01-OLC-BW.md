Served as the elected student chair on the programme committee for Human Movement Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The programme committee is responsible for advising the faculty on matters related to the curriculum, teaching quality, and student welfare. As chair, I facilitated discussions between students and faculty, ensuring that student voices were heard in decision-making processes.
