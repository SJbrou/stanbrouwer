To reflect and order thoughts concerning the themes of digitalization and sustainability throughout the Information Science master curriculum, students were asked to deliver a short write-up concerning these themes for each of the followed courses in the master. Some of the intended learning outcomes were to engage in a critical discussion about digital transformation of society and business, and the sustainability of this transition. 

Students were provided with a google sites template and template questions. Being students many ran off by copying study guides and template questions into their favourite LLM, and copied it into their template.
