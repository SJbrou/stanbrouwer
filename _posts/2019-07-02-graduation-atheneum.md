Graduated from Tabor College Werenfridus in Hoorn, Netherlands, with a VWO-NG diploma. This diploma is equivalent to the Dutch pre-university education (VWO) and is recognized as a qualification for university admission.

During my studies, I was actively involved in many extracurricular activities, including serving as the chairman of the student council, chair of the Multi-school council, directing the school newspaper, serving as junior mentor, and organizing debates and many other events. For these contributions the Rector and Conrector recognized me with a special mention during graduation. 


Graduated with a 9 for the final thesis on philosophical modernity in contemporary society, and a 7 GPA overall
