While studying statistics at university, I was introduced to R - and with it, the power of programming. At the time, I was working a side job, and the administration department was a bit of a mess. I quicky spotted the opportunity to put my new skills to use.
<br><br>
What started simple with sharing the HTML output from Rstudio quickly evolved into more professional tools like Shiny apps, PowerBI, and Python. I began developing basic reports and dashboards, which were well received.
<br><br>
Soon I was asked to support a few other local businesses with analyses, visualzations and administrative processes. Next to putting statistical and technical skills to use, I enjoy the interaction with entrepreneurs, discussing the insights the data reveals and, and thinking along how those insights can be put to use.
