While following university courses on statistics I was introduced to R. In my side-job the administration department was a mess, and I quickly saw the oppertunity to help out by applying some newly-learned programming skills. This started very basic with sharing the html output of Rstudio, but I quickly got introduced to more professional tools like Shiny apps, PowerBI and python.

I started to develop some basic reports and dashboards, which were well received. This led to me being asked to help out with some other local businesses, which I started doing on freelance basis. What I enjoy most is bouncing ideas around with entrepreneurs about what the data reveals and how they can use it to grow their business.
