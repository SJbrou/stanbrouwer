I'm growingly annoyed by the large number of companies and institutions that ask for feedback, but are not open to meaningfull discussion. 

I'll never forget how a TV-salesperson once telling me that they used 'an american grading scale' where everything below a 7/10 would be considered bad, which I should take into account when rating him. It's clear that such a feedback system is broken for everyone involved. 

But my frustration goes deeper. Often I'm asked to rate aspects of experiences numerically. However, I do not particularly care about the "friendliness" of customer service, but I'm certainly iritated by the never-ending teleprompting menu's for difficult questions. If my question is simple, I'll just look it up. I'm calling because I want to speak a *human*. The issue is not that I'm being asked for feedback, its the approach. Asking for feedback should involve a willingness to have an open conversation about the aspects that could be improved, not just a rating system designed to evaluate employees. And the more the willingness of people is being misused, the less real, meaningfull feeback will be submitted. 

When feedback systems are overly standardized, they fall pray to Goodhart's law. If you're asking for feedback, I expect more than just a number to check off; I expect a willingess to engage in a meaningfull exchange. 

But hey, these are just my thoughts, that might one day become a post.
