After taking several extracurricular courses on economics, I enrolled in dr. Lalin Anik in her course on Behavioral Economics. I was immediately fascinated by the subject and her engaging style of teaching (turned out she did not only inspire me, she was elected MBA professor of the year and earned many more awards). This experience sparked a broader intrest in teaching and pedagogy. 

During my bachelor's I taught a lot sports lessons as a side job, but never thought about teaching in a more academic setting. Motivated on the recent course I applied to become a teaching assistant at the faculty of business and economics, which was not my primary faculty. I was hired as a teaching assistant for the first year course on marketing, which was a success. This led to me being invited to help with the development of the last-year course on Digital Marketing Metrics, which I am currently involved in.
