After taking several extracurricular courses on economics, I enrolled in dr. Lalin Anik in her course on Behavioral Economics. I was immediately fascinated by the subject and her engaging style of teaching (turned out she did not only inspire me, she was elected MBA professor of the year and received many more awards). 
<br><br>

That course sparked a broader intrest in teaching and pedagogy. 
<br>
During my bachelor’s, I had plenty of experience teaching — mostly sports classes as a side job — but I had never considered teaching in an academic context. Motivated by my experience in Behavioral Economics, I applied to become a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Business and Economics, even though it wasn’t my primary faculty.<br>
As I completed many extracurricular courses on economics, I was hired to assist in the first-year marketing course, which turned out to be a great succes. As a result, I was invited to contribute to the development of the final-year course on digital marketing metrics, which I am currently involved in.
