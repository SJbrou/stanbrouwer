I'm Stan. Studying Information Science (and a bunch of other things) at the VU. I'm working on data science and web development projects. In my spare time I work-out in the morning and discover new music in the evening. I'm currently retired from cycling across europe with my brother, but have a great collection of photo's at iconic landmarks.
